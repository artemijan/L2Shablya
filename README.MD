# L2Shablya ‚öîÔ∏è üá∫üá¶

![Shablya](shablya.svg)

*Inspired by the swift, light, and deadly Kozak weapon, L2Shablya embodies precision and speed in every line of code.*

**Disclaimer**: *The name "Shablya" reflects the project's focus on performance and elegance, paying homage to the
iconic Kozak weapon. It is used here metaphorically and holds no association with real-world conflict or violence.*

Current state: `Under development`

About: This implementation is based on L2J, e.g. I reimplement everything in rust from java + I optimize things,
like DB denormalization for performance boost, removing unnecessary operations and so on.

## The client (Interlude Classic)

I don't use an old client of Interlude because graphics there is pretty old.\

[Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lL3Gv9p4v2yGGSiqRxShXS0xWU2LXcq8/view?usp=share_link) is the google drive link where
you can download the client. To play, you have to change IP in L2.ini file.

NOTE: if you disable CMD login in client, and try to run game from windows bash script it will not send "CreateChar" packet in lobby.
